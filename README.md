Repository
Animated octo spice uses a github repository with several sample extensions. You're encouraged to create your own extensions and push them to the repository.

How does it work?
The extension will inject the installed and updated js and css in the context of the website. This allows the css to overrule any styling, and the js to interact within the website context.

What's the difference with normal chrome extensions?
We are encouraging to fork and extend the extensions within the repository.
